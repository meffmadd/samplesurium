<p>
  Samplesurium is my own personal project focused on machine learning and visulalisation. 
  It is made with Angular as the front-end framework, p5 is used for the all the visual stuff 
  and tensorflow.js takes care of the machine learning part. For every example the whole code and an explaination
  are provided. It is and probably will always be a work in progress.
