# Introduction

This post is a **demonstration blog page** built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org). Its purpose is to showcase a wide range of Quarto features commonly used in technical blogs, documentation sites, and data science reports.

You will see examples of:

* Rich Markdown and typography
* Cross-references and callouts
* Code execution and syntax highlighting
* Tables and figures
* Mathematical notation
* Citations and footnotes
* Layouts and panels

---

# Basic Markdown Features

## Text Formatting

You can write text using **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, `inline code`, and ~~strikethrough~~.

> Blockquotes are useful for highlighting important ideas or quoting sources.

Horizontal rules help separate sections.

---

## Lists

### Unordered List

* Item one
* Item two

  * Nested item
  * Another nested item
* Item three

### Ordered List

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

# Callouts

Quarto provides callout blocks for structured emphasis.

::: callout-note

## Note

This is a note callout. It is useful for additional context or clarifications.
:::

::: callout-tip

## Tip

Use callouts to improve readability and guide your readers.
:::

::: callout-warning

## Warning

Be cautious when publishing executable code in public documents.
:::

::: callout-important

## Important

Callouts support titles, icons, and nested content.

# Code Blocks

## Syntax Highlighting

```python
import math

def area_of_circle(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2

area_of_circle(5)
```

```r
x <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)
y <- sin(x)
plot(x, y, type = "l", main = "Sine Wave")
```

## Executable Code (Optional)

If this document is rendered with a computational engine, code blocks can be executed and their output embedded directly in the page.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
sum(range(1, 11))
```

---

# Figures

You can include static images with captions and cross-references.

```{python}
#| label: fig-random
#| fig-cap: "A simple random scatter plot"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

x = [random.random() for _ in range(50)]
y = [random.random() for _ in range(50)]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

See @fig-random for an example figure.

## Observable Plot

Interactive plots can be created using Observable Plot, which provides a powerful grammar of graphics for JavaScript.

```{ojs}
data = {
  const co2data = await FileAttachment("data.csv").csv({ typed: true } );
  return co2data.map(d => { 
    d["decimal date"] = Number(d["decimal date"]);
    d.average = Number(d.average); 
    return d; 
  });
}
Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.line(data, 
      { x: "decimal date", y: "average"}, 
      { stroke: "black" }
    )
  ]
})
```

The plot above shows the long-term trend of atmospheric CO₂ concentrations from 1958 to 2025, demonstrating the steady increase over time.

# Tables

## Markdown Table

| Feature    | Supported | Notes                     |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Markdown   | Yes       | CommonMark compliant      |
| Jupyter    | Yes       | Python, R, Julia          |
| Cross-refs | Yes       | Figures, tables, sections |
| Publishing | Yes       | HTML, PDF, Word           |

## Computed Table

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
  "Language": ["Python", "R", "Julia"],
  "Use Case": ["General", "Statistics", "Scientific"],
  "Popularity": [1, 2, 3]
})

df
```

# Mathematics

Quarto supports LaTeX-style mathematics.

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Displayed equations:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} , dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

---

# Cross-References

You can reference sections, figures, and tables.

* See @sec-layouts for layout examples
* Refer back to @fig-random for the scatter plot
